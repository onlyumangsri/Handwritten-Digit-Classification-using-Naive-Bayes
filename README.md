# Handwritten Digit Classification using Naive Bayes

This is a project to classify handwritten characters into alphabet classes (A to
 Z) given in a CSV file.
 
 The project uses the coding language as Python with base implementation
 pushed with Gaussian and Multinomial formulation.
 
 A list of python packages are used such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn,
 scipy and os, for varying usage throughout the code. The usage are explained
 in the document and the code as well.
 
 The output is presented in the form of accuracy calculated and confusion
 matrix. Also, a simple mean plot is done for the pixel values for each class of
 alphabets.
 
 The problem includes building a Naive Bayes classifier and outcomes consist of
 confusion matrix, and overall accuracy of the prediction done.
